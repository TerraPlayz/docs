2. Create a pull request according to the [docs](https://www.is-a.dev/docs).

3. Wait for the pull request to be merged.

4. Run `DBH!server proxy username.is-a.dev serverId` to set up the server proxy.
   - Here, `username` is your subdomain (the text before `.is-a.dev`).
   - Get the `serverId` by running `DBH!server list`. Look for your server's name and note its server ID.
